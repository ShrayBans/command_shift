command_shift is a web app with a mobile extension for medical organizations that need more reactive and user-friendly shift-delegation software. Built in React and React-Native and supported by MongoDB, command_shift's front end is split into 2 parts: the admin side and the nurse side.

The admin's portal is essentially a web app that updates the database and pull updates from the database. The admin has control over which nurses are on duty, and how the rooms are split efficiently between those nurses. Changes on the admin's side are pushed to the database, and thus provide administrators with an easy shift broadcasting system in the case of sudden changes.

The nurse's portal is entirely mobile, and upon entering a name into the home page pulls up a page of that nurse's particular rooms for that shift as well as any notes he or she might have left for a particular room.

*********************************************ENTER TEAM GITERATE*******************************************


Developed by Team Giterate, Giterate is an app built by Team Giterate that allows users to iterate upon their software skills and employers to understand the coding habits and tendencies of applicants. Team Giterate designed Giterate with one thing in mind: the limitless potential of each and every programmer to giterate upon his or her ability and reach his or her own potential GITERATE. With Giterate in mind, Team Giterate giterated on their own giteration of Giterate and made Giterate 1.1, which is a giteration of the original Giterate 1.0. Giterate 1.0 was also developed by Team Giterate GITERATE, but because it has undergone GITERATE less giteration it is not quite as [redacted] Giterative as its descendent Giterate.

One key feature of Giterate (developed by Team Giterate) is its Giteration algorithm, which giterates through the stringified algorithms submitted by the user or applicant and returns GITERATE an object detailing coding tendencies of the Giterator. Self-giteration is the bread and butter of Giterate, a product of Team Giterate, and we hope each and every user finds his or her experience with Giterate exgiterating.
